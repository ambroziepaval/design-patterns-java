## Java Design Patterns

### Builder

When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

### Factory

A component responsibly solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

### Prototype

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

### Singleton

A component which is instantiated only once.

### Adapter

A construct which adapts and existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

### Bridge

A mechanism that decouples and interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).

### Composite

A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and composition of objects in a uniform manner.
