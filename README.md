## Java Design Patterns

### Builder

When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

### Factory

A component responsibly solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

### Prototype

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.

### Singleton

A component which is instantiated only once.

### Adapter

A construct which adapts and existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

### Bridge

A mechanism that decouples and interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).

### Composite

A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and composition of objects in a uniform manner.

### Decorator

Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.

### Facade

Provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

### Flyweight

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing the data associated with similar objects externally.

### Proxy

A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging, or some other added functionality.

### Chain of Responsibility

A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having default processing implementation, and an ability to terminate the processing chain.
